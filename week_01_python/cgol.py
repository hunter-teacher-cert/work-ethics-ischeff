#    The Rules of Life:
#    Survivals:
#    * A cell with 2 or 3 living neighbours will survive for the next generation.
#    Death:
#    * Each cell with >3 neighbours will die from overpopulation.
#    * Every cell with <2 neighbours will die from isolation.
#    Birth:
#    * Each dead cell adjacent to exactly 3 living neighbours is a birth cell. It will come alive next generation.
#    NOTA BENE:  All births and deaths occur simultaneously. Together, they constitute a single generation
