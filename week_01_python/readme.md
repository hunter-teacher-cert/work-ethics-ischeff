* This folder contains projects designed to demonstrate some transfer of skills from java (learned this summer) to python (learning now).
* My aim is to translate Conway's Game of Life (originally written this summer in java) and also one additional program that will use dictionaries somehow. (If I can't figure out how to use dictionaries in CGOL.)
* I've also added implementations of the Collatz Conjecture, both recursive and iterative, which I wrote to practice the python syntax and lingo for functions.
